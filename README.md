The dataset on which the Exploaitairy Data Analysis is done is SOFIFA based FIFA rating of players in the year 2018.

Ther are lots of attributes capturted on the dataset , starting from name, nation_team , football_club , to positional play of each player

So the intention was here to find the or predict the overall value of a player i.e the FIFA rating of a player based on attributes like pace, dribbling , shooting , skill_moves ,defesive strength , passing _strength etc. 

First the complete dataset was wrangled , cleaned to work on it , upon which the data analysis was done on specific attributes of the player which may impact the player overall value.

Here we have used two algorithm to predict the raitng those are :
* Linear Regression
* XGBoost 

After the model is trained we could observe a accouracy score of around 95% , so we could observe that the model is very well able to precict the rating of a player.
